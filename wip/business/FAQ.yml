      - question: |
          Are the Windows Insider Program and Windows Insider Program for Business different programs?
        answer: |
          No, the Windows Insider Program for Business is just one of the audiences we serve through the Windows Insider Program. With extra features focused on helping enterprises participate in the program, businesses can better prepare for the future as Windows Insiders, and we can get valuable feedback from key customers to help improve Windows.

      - question: |
          Do I have to have a Microsoft Entra account to join?
        answer: |
          Yes, currently we're only supporting Microsoft Entra ID for corporate accounts. Make sure you use the same active account that you use to access your work email and other Microsoft services when registering.
          
          To check if your work account is on Microsoft Entra ID, go to **[Settings > Accounts > Access work and school](https://aka.ms/WorkAccountSettings)** on a device with your work account connected. Your account will say it's connected to your company's Microsoft Entra ID if it's on Microsoft Entra ID.
          
          If you don't have a Microsoft Entra ID, you can still [join the program using your Microsoft account](../get-started.md), but you won't be able to manage updates across devices in your company or tag and track feedback as an enterprise.
          
      - question: |
          If I have more than one Microsoft Entra account, which should I use?
        answer: |
          Make sure you use the same active account that you use to access your work email and other Microsoft services when registering.
          
          Use a production tenant of Microsoft Entra ID, not a test tenant, to make the most of the program. The Microsoft Entra tenant is just used for authentication, so you won't need to worry about changes to it from the the program.
          
      - question: |
          If I just want to participate as a Windows Insider, do I still need to register my Microsoft Entra account?
        answer: |
          No, you can [join the Windows Insider Program using your Microsoft account](../get-started.md), but you won't be able to manage Insider Preview builds or track feedback across your organization if you don't register with a Microsoft Entra account.
          
      - question: |
          If I'm already a Windows Insider with my Microsoft account, how can I switch to my Microsoft Entra account?
        answer: |
          First, you have to [register for the program with your Microsoft Entra account](./register.md). Once you've done that, go to **[Settings > Accounts > Access work and school](https://aka.ms/WorkAccountSettings)** to make sure your Microsoft Entra account is connected to your device. Then, go to **[Settings > Update & Security > Windows Insider Program](https://aka.ms/WIPSettings)** to change which Windows Insider account your device is connected to.
          
      - question: |
          How do I register for the Windows Insider Program for Business?
        answer: |
          [Use these instructions to register for the Windows Insider Program for Business.](./register.md)
          
      - question: |
          Do I have to be an administrator on my device to run Windows 10 Insider Preview Builds?
        answer: |
          Yes, you must be an admin on your device to change your update settings, so you can receive Insider Preview builds.
          
          If you don't have admin access on your work device, you can still [join the program on your personal device with your individual Microsoft account](../get-started.md).
          
      - question: |
          Can I flight on more than one of my devices from the same registered account?
        answer: |
          Yes, you can flight on as many devices as you'd like. Just make sure when giving feedback to file it from the device you're experiencing the issue on, so any diagnostic data that's included will show the issue.

      - question: |
          How do I set up and manage Insider Preview builds not just on my device, but across my organization?
        answer: |
          [Administrators can install and manage Insider Preview builds centrally across multiple devices in your organizational domain.](./manage-builds.md) This requires a Microsoft Entra domain, which must be registered in the Windows Insider Program.
          
      - question: |
          Should I use Insider Preview builds in a live operating environment?
        answer: |
          We do not recommend organizations run Insider Preview builds outside of their test environments. These preview builds aren't the final versions, and they may change before commercial release or not be released commercially at all. 

      - question: |
          How do I use the Feedback Hub with my business account?
        answer: |
          To use the [Feedback Hub](https://aka.ms/WIPFeedbackHub) as an enterprise, you must have registered with a Microsoft Entra account. When you submit feedback to us through that account, you can track feedback from other users in your organization, and we can track your company's issues and suggestions.
          
          If you were using the Feedback Hub with a Microsoft account before, your old feedback will not be transferred to your Microsoft Entra account. You'll have to switch back to your other account in Feedback Hub to access the feedback or badges tied to it. [Learn more about giving feedback as a business.](./feedback.md)
          
      - question: |
          Why am I getting a something went wrong error message in Feedback Hub?
        answer: |
          You must be an admin to give an app access to your profile data, which means Microsoft Entra admins must allow the Feedback Hub to see your info. If your Microsoft Entra admin has blocked that option, you'll see this error message when logging in with your Microsoft Entra account.
          
          Admins can unblock this in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) under **Enterprise applications > User Settings** by enabling **Users can consent to apps accessing company data on their behalf data**. 
          
      - question: |
          Do devices need to have a Windows 10 license to run Insider Preview builds? 
        answer: |
          Yes, all devices need to have a valid Windows 10 license to run Insider Preview builds.
